Use of autoencoders for anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is another unsupervised task, where the objective is to learn a normal profile given only the normal data examples and then identify the samples not conforming to the normal profile as anomalies. This can be applied in different applications such as fraud detection, system monitoring, etc. The use of autoencoders for this tasks, follows the assumption that a trained autoencoder would learn the latent subspace of normal samples. Once trained, it would result with a low reconstruction error for normal samples, and high reconstruction error for anomalies [21, 18, 62, 61].

# CNN AE 

### **Model Description: CNN Autoencoder with Time-Frequency Fusion**

We present a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Autoencoder** model designed to process both **time-domain** and **frequency-domain** signals simultaneously. The model leverages the complementary information from these two domains to enhance interference detection in satellite communication systems. The architecture is carefully designed to fuse features from both domains, enabling the model to capture both temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics effectively.

---

#### **1. Model Overview**
The proposed CNN Autoencoder consists of two parallel **encoders** for processing time-domain (signal) and frequency-domain (spectrum) data, a **fusion layer** to combine the encoded features, and two **decoders** to reconstruct the original signals. The model is trained to minimize the reconstruction error for both domains, ensuring that the learned latent representation captures essential features from both time and frequency perspectives.

---

#### **2. Encoder Architecture**
The encoder part of the model is divided into two branches, each dedicated to processing one type of input data:

- **Time-Domain Encoder**:  
  - **Input**: A 1D time-domain signal of shape `[batch_size, 1, sequence_length]`.  
  - **Layers**:  
    - **Conv1D (1 ‚Üí 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)**: Extracts local temporal features.  
    - **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.  
    - **MaxPool1D (pool_size=2)**: Reduces dimensionality by downsampling.  
    - **Conv1D (16 ‚Üí 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)**: Further refines feature extraction.  
    - **ReLU Activation**: Ensures non-linear transformations.  
    - **MaxPool1D (pool_size=2)**: Final downsampling step.  
  - **Output**: A flattened feature vector representing the encoded time-domain signal.

- **Frequency-Domain Encoder**:  
  - **Input**: A 1D frequency-domain spectrum of shape `[batch_size, 1, sequence_length]`.  
  - **Layers**:  
    - The same architecture as the time-domain encoder, ensuring symmetry in processing.  
  - **Output**: A flattened feature vector representing the encoded frequency-domain spectrum.

---

#### **3. Feature Fusion**
The encoded features from both domains are concatenated along the feature dimension to create a **fused representation**. This step is critical as it combines temporal and spectral information into a single latent space. The fused features are then passed through a **fully connected (FC) layer** to further refine the representation:

- **Fusion Layer**:  
  - **Concatenation**: Combines the time-domain and frequency-domain feature vectors.  
  - **FC Layer**: Maps the concatenated features to a lower-dimensional latent space of size `latent_dim`.  
  - **ReLU Activation**: Ensures non-linearity in the fused representation.

---

#### **4. Decoder Architecture**
The decoder part of the model reconstructs the original signals from the fused latent representation. It consists of two branches, each dedicated to reconstructing one type of output:

- **Time-Domain Decoder**:  
  - **FC Layer**: Maps the latent representation back to a higher-dimensional space.  
  - **Reshape**: Converts the flattened vector into a 3D tensor suitable for transposed convolution.  
  - **ConvTranspose1D (32 ‚Üí 16, kernel_size=2, stride=2)**: Upsamples the feature map.  
  - **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.  
  - **ConvTranspose1D (16 ‚Üí 1, kernel_size=2, stride=2)**: Reconstructs the original time-domain signal.  

- **Frequency-Domain Decoder**:  
  - The same architecture as the time-domain decoder, ensuring symmetry in reconstruction.  
  - **Output**: Reconstructed frequency-domain spectrum.

---

#### **5. Loss Function**
The model is trained using a **mean squared error (MSE) loss** function, which measures the difference between the original and reconstructed signals for both domains. The total loss is computed as the sum of the reconstruction errors for the time-domain and frequency-domain signals:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{\text{signal}}, y_{\text{signal}}) + \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{\text{spectrum}}, y_{\text{spectrum}})
\]

This ensures that the model learns to accurately reconstruct both types of signals, capturing their unique characteristics.

---

#### **6. Key Innovations**
- **Dual-Input Processing**: The model processes both time-domain and frequency-domain signals simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information.  
- **Feature Fusion**: The concatenation of encoded features from both domains ensures a rich latent representation.  
- **Symmetrical Architecture**: The encoder and decoder branches for both domains share a similar structure, ensuring balanced processing.  
- **End-to-End Training**: The model is trained end-to-end, optimizing both reconstruction tasks jointly.

---

#### **7. Summary**
The proposed CNN Autoencoder is a powerful model for interference detection in satellite communication systems. By fusing time-domain and frequency-domain features, it captures both temporal and spectral patterns, enabling robust detection of anomalies. The symmetrical architecture and end-to-end training ensure efficient learning and accurate reconstruction of both signal types.

# Linear VAE 

### **Model Description: Linear Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Time-Frequency Fusion**

We introduce a **Linear Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** model designed to process both **time-domain** and **frequency-domain** signals simultaneously. This model leverages the strengths of variational inference to learn a probabilistic latent representation that fuses features from both domains. By combining temporal and spectral information, the model enhances its ability to detect and reconstruct interference in satellite communication systems.

---

#### **1. Model Overview**
The proposed Linear VAE consists of two parallel **encoders** for processing time-domain (signal) and frequency-domain (spectrum) data, a **fusion mechanism** to combine the encoded features into a probabilistic latent space, and two **decoders** to reconstruct the original signals. The model is trained to minimize both the reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, ensuring that the latent representation captures meaningful features from both domains.

---

#### **2. Encoder Architecture**
The encoder part of the model is divided into two branches, each dedicated to processing one type of input data:

- **Time-Domain Encoder**:  
  - **Input**: A 1D time-domain signal of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]`.  
  - **Layers**:  
    - **Linear (seq_len ‚Üí 512)**: Projects the input into a higher-dimensional space.  
    - **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.  
    - **Linear (512 ‚Üí latent_dim)**: Maps the features to a latent space of size `latent_dim`.  
    - **ReLU Activation**: Ensures non-linear transformations.  
  - **Output**: A latent vector representing the encoded time-domain signal.

- **Frequency-Domain Encoder**:  
  - **Input**: A 1D frequency-domain spectrum of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]`.  
  - **Layers**:  
    - The same architecture as the time-domain encoder, ensuring symmetry in processing.  
  - **Output**: A latent vector representing the encoded frequency-domain spectrum.

---

#### **3. Feature Fusion and Probabilistic Latent Space**
The encoded features from both domains are concatenated along the feature dimension to create a **fused representation**. This step is critical as it combines temporal and spectral information into a single latent space. The fused features are then passed through two separate **fully connected (FC) layers** to compute the mean (\(\mu\)) and log-variance (\(\log \sigma^2\)) of the latent distribution:

- **Fusion Layer**:  
  - **Concatenation**: Combines the time-domain and frequency-domain latent vectors.  
  - **FC Layer for \(\mu\)**: Maps the concatenated features to the mean of the latent distribution.  
  - **FC Layer for \(\log \sigma^2\)**: Maps the concatenated features to the log-variance of the latent distribution.  

- **Reparameterization Trick**:  
  - The latent vector \(z\) is sampled using the reparameterization trick:  
    \[
    z = \mu + \epsilon \cdot \sigma, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
    \]  
  - This ensures differentiability during training while introducing stochasticity.

---

#### **4. Decoder Architecture**
The decoder part of the model reconstructs the original signals from the sampled latent vector \(z\). It consists of two branches, each dedicated to reconstructing one type of output:

- **Time-Domain Decoder**:  
  - **Linear (latent_dim ‚Üí 512)**: Projects the latent vector into a higher-dimensional space.  
  - **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.  
  - **Linear (512 ‚Üí seq_len)**: Reconstructs the original time-domain signal.  

- **Frequency-Domain Decoder**:  
  - The same architecture as the time-domain decoder, ensuring symmetry in reconstruction.  
  - **Output**: Reconstructed frequency-domain spectrum.

---

#### **5. Loss Function**
The model is trained using a **composite loss function** that combines reconstruction error and KL divergence:

- **Reconstruction Loss**: Measures the difference between the original and reconstructed signals for both domains using mean squared error (MSE):  
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{\text{signal}}, y_{\text{signal}}) + \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{\text{spectrum}}, y_{\text{spectrum}}).
  \]  

- **KL Divergence**: Regularizes the latent space to approximate a standard Gaussian distribution:  
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} (1 + \log \sigma_i^2 - \mu_i^2 - \sigma_i^2).
  \]  

- **Total Loss**: The final loss is a weighted sum of the reconstruction loss and KL divergence:  
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} + \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}},
  \]  
  where \(\alpha\) is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and latent space regularization.

---

#### **6. Key Innovations**
- **Dual-Input Processing**: The model processes both time-domain and frequency-domain signals simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information.  
- **Probabilistic Latent Space**: The use of variational inference enables the model to learn a robust and interpretable latent representation.  
- **Feature Fusion**: The concatenation of encoded features from both domains ensures a rich latent representation.  
- **Symmetrical Architecture**: The encoder and decoder branches for both domains share a similar structure, ensuring balanced processing.  
- **End-to-End Training**: The model is trained end-to-end, optimizing both reconstruction and regularization tasks jointly.

---

#### **7. Summary**
The proposed Linear VAE is a powerful model for interference detection in satellite communication systems. By fusing time-domain and frequency-domain features into a probabilistic latent space, it captures both temporal and spectral patterns, enabling robust detection of anomalies. The symmetrical architecture and end-to-end training ensure efficient learning and accurate reconstruction of both signal types.

### **Experimental Results and Analysis**  
The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated against a conventional Energy Detection (ED) baseline, which computes the energy threshold $\beta_E$ by optimizing the AUC score on the test dataset. For a received signal $\mathbf{y}_n$, the energy $E_n = \sum_{i=1}^N |y_n[i]|^2$ is compared to $\beta_E$ to detect interference. The ED method achieves **71.67\% accuracy** and **0.7167 AUC**, with perfect precision (100.0\%) but critically low recall (43.35\%), reflecting its propensity for false negatives under non-Gaussian noise conditions.  

Our proposed models‚Äî**LinearAE, CNNAE, TransformerAE, LinearVAE, CNNVAE, and TransformerVAE**‚Äîleverage fused time-frequency domain inputs to address these limitations. Architectural variants span linear, convolutional, and transformer-based feature extractors, enabling a systematic exploration of anomaly detection robustness.  

#### **Performance Comparison**  
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:model_performance}, **CNNAE** achieves the highest AUC (**0.9175**) among all models, surpassing the ED baseline by **20.08\%** and demonstrating the efficacy of convolutional architectures in capturing localized interference signatures. The deterministic autoencoder (AE) class consistently outperforms variational autoencoders (VAE), with **CNNAE** exceeding **CNNVAE** by **3.51\%** in AUC, suggesting that probabilistic latent spaces may introduce unnecessary complexity for this task.  

The **LinearAE** model, despite its simplicity (4.20M parameters), delivers competitive performance (AUC: 0.9176), highlighting the sufficiency of linear projections for interference detection in fused representations. However, its marginally lower recall (81.81\% vs. CNNAE: 81.68\%) underscores the value of hierarchical feature learning in mission-critical scenarios.  

#### **Architectural Efficiency**  
Computational efficiency is critical for real-time deployment:  
- **Linear Models**: **LinearAE** (4.20M parameters) and **LinearVAE** (2.40M) achieve near-instant inference (0.0216‚Äì0.0253 thresholds), ideal for edge devices with stringent latency constraints.  
- **CNNs**: **CNNAE** (2.47M parameters) and **CNNVAE** (2.50M) balance performance and efficiency, requiring **60\% fewer parameters** than transformer variants while delivering superior AUC.  
- **Transformers**: **TransformerVAE** (27.50M parameters) fails to justify its complexity, achieving only **0.8733 AUC**‚Äîa **4.42\% deficit** relative to CNNAE. This inefficacy stems from overparameterization and the absence of inductive bias for localized interference patterns.  

#### **Training Dynamics**  
Transformer architectures exhibit pronounced instability:  
- **TransformerAE** collapses entirely (AUC: 0.6690), with training loss oscillations indicating poor convergence.  
- **TransformerVAE** struggles to optimize its 27.50M parameters, achieving subpar recall (78.64\%) despite extensive training.  

These results challenge the applicability of self-attention mechanisms to interference detection, where signals are better treated as **global entities** rather than sequential time series. The failure of autoregressive modeling aligns with the spectral nature of interference, which lacks temporal dependencies exploitable by transformers.  

#### **Practical Implications**  
1. **Mission-Critical Systems**: Deploy **CNNAE** for optimal AUC (0.9175) and robust recall (81.68\%).  
2. **Edge Deployment**: Use **LinearAE** (AUC: 0.9176) where computational resources are constrained.  
3. **Avoid Transformers**: Their excessive parameter counts (27.50M) and marginal gains do not justify operational costs.

**Figure 1** illustrates the ROC curves for all models, with CNNAE dominating the upper-left quadrant, reflecting its superior TPR-FPR balance. The ED baseline‚Äôs steep precision-recall asymmetry (100.0\% precision vs. 43.35\% recall) further validates the need for learned representations over energy-based heuristics.  

These findings underscore the superiority of **convolutional architectures** and **multi-modal fusion** in interference detection, establishing a new benchmark for robustness in satellite communication systems.
