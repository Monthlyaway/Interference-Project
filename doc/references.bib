  abstract   = {Recently, non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite communication constellations have regained popularity due to their ability to provide global coverage and lower-latency connectivity. However, the new wave of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations operate on the same spectral bands as legacy satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GSO), which concurrently access the electromagnetic spectrum. Even if international regulations are in place, such increased spectral congestion will result in interference events. Therefore, both regulator entities and GSO operators have a high interest in detecting illegal or unlicensed NGSO interference sources. In this work, we simulate a realistic downlink interference scenario by emulating an actual commercial NGSO orbit whose signal is eventually received in a GSO receiver that is pointed toward a specific GSO satellite. We design an autoencoder deep neural network and we evaluate its performance considering both time-series and frequency-domain series of the overall received samples. Extensive numerical results are presented, validating the interference detection accuracy and comparing both domains of inputs at the autoencoder.},

  abstract = {Summary The interest towards the deployment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO)/Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite systems in several frequency bands is increasing due to the requirement of low latency for real-time systems and high demand of broadband data. When the number of usable Non-Geostationary (NGEO) satellites, that is, LEO/MEO in space, increases, the frequency coexistence between the NGEO satellite systems with the already existing geostationary (GEO) satellite networks becomes a requisite. In this context, it is crucial to explore interference mitigation techniques between GEO and NGEO systems in order to allow their spectral coexistence. More specifically, in the coexistence scenario of GEO and NGEO satellite networks, in-line interference may be a serious problem, especially in the equatorial region. In this paper, we provide several frequency sharing studies in the context of the coexistence of an NGEO satellite link with another NGEO/GEO satellite link. Furthermore, we carry out interference analysis between GEO and MEO satellite systems considering the case of the O3b satellite system and propose an adaptive power control technique for both the uplink and downlink scenarios in order to mitigate the in-line interference. Moreover, we suggest several cognitive solutions for mitigating the in-line interference and provide future research issues. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, transformers, GNSS navigation, and telecommunication systems are part of critical infrastructure. Industry, transportation, service operations, farming, and everyday life highly depend on this infrastructure. However, these systems are very sensitive to solar activity. Therefore, all activities above are vulnerable and defenseless against the catastrophic changes in Earth's cosmic environment. The Solar System is dominated by the influence of our star. A small fraction of the energy produced in the core of our star turns into a magnetic field and emits the constant high-velocity flow, the solar wind. Solar magnetic activity produces radiation and ejects matter from the upper atmosphere of our star. The magnetic field of the solar wind interacts with the planetary magnetic fields and atmospheres. These phenomena, called Space Weather have a serious influence on the radiation environment of Earth where telecommunication, Global Navigation Satellite System, meteorological, and other purpose satellites are located. The conductivity and transparency of the higher partly ionized atmospheric layer, the ionosphere also depend on solar radiation and activity. This fact makes the navigation and communication systems dependent on solar activity. Finally, the solar magnetic activity creates magnetic variations in the terrestrial magnetic field and induces currents in gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, and transformers. In this short briefing, we introduce the solar activity phenomena, and their influence on our planet's cosmic neighborhood and provide a detailed description of the Space Weather effects on critical infrastructure. We describe the Hungarian national and global space weather forecast centers and capabilities. Finally, we share some guidelines on how to prepare for extreme space weather events.},
