  abstract = {Recently, non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite communication constellations have regained popularity due to their ability to provide global coverage and lower-latency connectivity. However, the new wave of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations operate on the same spectral bands as legacy satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GSO), which concurrently access the electromagnetic spectrum. Even if international regulations are in place, such increased spectral congestion will result in interference events. Therefore, both regulator entities and GSO operators have a high interest in detecting illegal or unlicensed NGSO interference sources. In this work, we simulate a realistic downlink interference scenario by emulating an actual commercial NGSO orbit whose signal is eventually received in a GSO receiver that is pointed toward a specific GSO satellite. We design an autoencoder deep neural network and we evaluate its performance considering both time-series and frequency-domain series of the overall received samples. Extensive numerical results are presented, validating the interference detection accuracy and comparing both domains of inputs at the autoencoder.},

  abstract = {SummaryOne of the important functions of cognitive radio (CR) technology is spectrum sensing. The implementation of an efficient spectrum sensing function can be quite challenging because of various factors such as multi-path fading, low signal-to-noise ratio of the radio communication services to be detected and the requirement to detect and analyze the signal in a short time. As a consequence, it is important to quantitatively assess the performance of spectrum sensing techniques in various scenarios. This paper investigates different digital signal processing techniques for spectrum sensing in the context of mobile satellite transmissions: power sensing, cyclostationary sensing, efficient cyclostationary sensing based on FFT accumulation method and strip spectral correlation algorithm. This paper presents experimental results on the cyclostationary properties of GSM Thuraya mobile satellite communications in various conditions both for the uplink and downlink channels. The receiver operating characteristics are computed, and the results are presented for different algorithms and different positions of the satellite terminals. The experimental results show that the cyclostationary-feature-based detection can be robust compared to energy-based technique for low signal-to-noise ratio levels.

  abstract = {With the number of multi-beam satellites in the non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) constellations increases by hundreds to thousands, the interference between geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite systems and NGSO constellations changes dynamically, and interference analysis will become very complicated. To address this problem, a dual-step interference analysis method based on space-discrete is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we discretizes the spatial positions of the reference NGSO satellite by dividing the latitude and longitude grids, and obtain the probability density function of the reference NGSO satellite. We analyze the aggregate interference caused by NGSO constellations to GSO systems, respectively, both in the uplink and downlink on the basis of interference-to-noise-ratio (I/N) and interference probability. The results show that there is severe interference between the NGSO and GSO systems and the aggregate interference level is affected by the locations of GSO earth station. Especially in the equatorial region, the interference is most serious. Furthermore, compared with commercial software Visualyse Professional, the proposed method can greatly improve the simulation efficiency while ensuring the accuracy.},

  abstract = {The new wave of mega-constellations in low-earth orbits (LEOs), which occupy frequency bands that are also used by legacy geostationary orbit satellites (GSOs), will eventually result in increased interference events. In this paper, we explore the application of unsupervised deep learning models, specifically convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), for detecting non-Geostationary Orbit Satellite (NGSO) interference in GSO ground stations (GGS). We propose and evaluate two DL models, the CAE1D model handling amplitude values as 1D data, and the CAE2D model handling In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples as 2D data. Through rigorous experimentation, we examine the models’ performance against traditional energy detector (ED) methods, employing single-model (SM) and multi-models (MMs) approaches for training the models. Our findings reveal that DL models, particularly under the MMs approach, significantly outperform conventional methods with up to 11\% in the probability of detecting interference, demonstrating the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of satellite communication systems, especially for such fastvarying interference environments (LEO mobility), where only GSO interference-free signals are needed for training the models.

  abstract = {Recent advancements in satellite communications have highlighted the challenge of interference detection, especially with the new generation of non-geostationary orbit satellites (NGSOs) that share the same frequency bands as legacy geostationary orbit satellites (GSOs). Despite existing radio regulations during the filing stage, this heightened congestion in the spectrum is likely to lead to instances of interference during real-time operations. This paper addresses the NGSO-to-GSO interference problem by proposing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect interference events. In particular, we focus on the downlink interference case, where signals from low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOs) potentially impact the signals received at the GSO ground stations (GGSs). In addition to the widely used autoencoder-based models (AEs), we design, develop, and train two generative AI-based models (GenAI), which are a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a transformer-based interference detector (TrID). These models generate samples of the expected GSO signal, whose error with respect to the input signal is used to flag interference. Actual satellite positions, trajectories, and realistic system parameters are used to emulate the interference scenarios and validate the proposed models. Numerical evaluation reveals that the models exhibit higher accuracy for detecting interference in the time-domain signal representations compared to the frequency-domain representations. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that TrID significantly outperforms the other models as well as the traditional energy detector (ED) approach, showing an increase of up to 31.23\% in interference detection accuracy, offering an innovative and efficient solution to a pressing challenge in satellite communications.},
